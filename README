== Notes for Facemash
hash map of all my friends, mark the value as one (keyed of userid)
traverse every friend and try to insert into hash map
if a 2nd degree friend already exists in hash map, ignore
if a 2nd degree friend does not exist, insert into hash map with a value of 2

== Pre-cache the next mashup
- On first load, we have nothing in cache, so we load one set, and then background load a second set
- When the user makes a decision, the pre-cached set gets displayed and we background load a new set

Remove game-mode that keeps a user around

Add a Rematch/Remash button

If a network request fails, automatically call Remash

Cancel all network requests when leaving facemashviewcontroller (back to launcher)
