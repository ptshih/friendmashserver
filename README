== TODO ==
Add a security HTTP-HEADER to all requests to protect API

Fix routes.rb

each name will link to touch.facebook.com/friendId in webview

Pre-cache the next mashup
- On first load, we have nothing in cache, so we load one set, and then background load a second set
- When the user makes a decision, the pre-cached set gets displayed and we background load a new set

Pass metrics data in HTTP HEADERS
- current user id
- current app version
- current device uuid
- send in HTTP HEADERS how long it took a user to make a decision

Leaderboards for In Network
Compatibility rating
- member of the same groups
- interests, musics, likes, relationship status

based on who you choose over time
we present you with a top list of people who seem most compatible with you and their ranking/score

you want to know who voted for you and who liked you

a user needs to have his own table for how many times he voted for a specific person
then we have a top leaderboards of who he likes, and vice versa
- vote number (integer)

percentage of friend network voted on out of personal social network
the more you play the more chances of completion
but when friends or friends of friends add new friends, the percentage gets smaller

percentage of total users voted on
- shows that this thing is huge and growing

show statistics for like how many votes/likes
how many times you won
- your ranking
- your score
- your wins
- your losses
- your percentage complete in network
- your percentage complete in world
- your top 10 compatibility list
- your top 10 admirers
- how many battles have you played
- average decision time

== DONE ==
hash map of all my friends, mark the value as one (keyed of userid)
traverse every friend and try to insert into hash map
if a 2nd degree friend already exists in hash map, ignore
if a 2nd degree friend does not exist, insert into hash map with a value of 2

Add work history and school history

Remove game-mode that keeps a user around

Add a Rematch/Remash button

If a network request fails, automatically call Remash

Cancel all network requests when leaving facemashviewcontroller (back to launcher)

== Ver. 2 ==
Segmentation by age, relative hotness level

in the future we can do a work network and school network mash

New Game Types:
- 4 person mode
- Elimination round (mortal combat)
- Bachelorette mode

== Notes ==
want to allow people to feel like they accomplished something by playing
want to get people to come back and play more
want to get people to see their progress (percentage complete), achievements
